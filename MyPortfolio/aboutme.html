                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Yugant Patel and I am currently enrolled in the Computer Programming and Analysis
                    Course at Georgian College, a 3-year Advanced Diploma Program.I chose this course due to its
                    comprehensive IT curriculum and the opportunity to gain real-world experience through two co-op
                    terms.
                </p>
                <h1>Technical Skills</h1>
                <div class="mySkillContainer">
                    <p>Programming has been my passion since the 10th grade, and I have developed expertise in
                        several programming languages such as Java, C, Javascript, and Python. From the word expertise I
                        mean
                        that I have a clear understanding about these languages and I am working on to develop
                        intermediate skills, I have not developed the advanced skills yet but I will reach there in
                        near
                        future.I have also completed several complex projects, some of them were completed
                        individually
                        and others in a team that demonstrate my technical skills along with team work skills. Elaborating on my projects, mostly I have worked on Java and
                        python projects to develop intermediate desktop applications but these were achieved as a
                        team
                        and I have used C language to make an customer billing system, complex calculator and some
                        small
                        projects like quiz game by my own.</p>
                </div>
                <h1>Soft Skills</h1>
                <div class="mySkillContainer">
                    <p> Apart from technical skills, I also developed some strong soft skills that are equally
                        essential in a professional environment. I have excellent emotional control,
                        decision-making abilities, problem-solving skills, team-work skills and communication
                        skills. I can make informed decisions even in critical situations. My problem solving
                        skills helped me to achieve expected outcomes in the projects I previously mentioned
                        because I always divide problems into parts and search its possible solution
                        accordingly. If you have any further questions, I would be delighted to elaborate on any
                        aspect of my qualifications.
                    </p>
